THIS is an ideal text-book for teachers of Latin, for it
enables them, while following a rigorously scientific method‚
to impart interest, freshness, and variety to the teaching of
the elements of the language.

It is an ideal text-book for beginners in Latin, for by its
use they are able to master the rudiments of the language
with ease and rapidity‚ and without the usual tediousness
and drudgery.

The reasons why this book stands the test of the school-
room are:

Because it is brief, simple, and attractive‚ and at the same
time thorough and scholarly.

Because at an early stage it introduces easy reading les-
sons to illustrate forms and principles already studied.

Because it presents continuity in the separate exercises
for translation into English and into Latin, introduced as
early and followed out as fully as practicable.

Because it distributes difficulties and secures great scope,
variety, and flexibility in practice by bringing forward cer-
tain of the pronouns and certain constructions that are
usually deferred till later and massed together.
