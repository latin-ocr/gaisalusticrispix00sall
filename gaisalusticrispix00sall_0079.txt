punished by money fines, and it would appear that the horrible
crime of murder of a parent was for some time the only one which
received a heavier punishment. The process against parricide
proper was by degrees extended to common murder, and even other
crimes of a religious nature. ‘⁶' The most important point [in the
development] was without doubt that in which an end was put to all
