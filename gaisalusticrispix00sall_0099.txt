instructos ordines: the acies, or army in line of battle, of this
period consisted of either two or three lines of cohorts, each cohort
counting sixty men in front, and ten deep. This was the Roman
system, equally removed from the unwieldy phalanx of the Greeks,
and the extreme thinness of the English line.

remotis equis, compare Caesar, BG. i. 25.—pedes (ἓ 88. c).
on foot. -— sinistros, on lzis lest.

reliquarum signa, twelve in number. The cohort was formed of
three maniples, and each maniple had its „regnum (a staff with some
figure or badge at the end) or vexillum (a flag, attached by its upper
edge to a cross-piece at the end of the staff). The cohort appears
to have had no standard, probably because it existed as a regular
organization only after the time of Marius, before whom the maniple
was the sole division of the legion. The standard of the legion, es-
tablished by Marius, was a silver eagle.

centuriones: two centurions commanded each maniple. —omnis
lectos, all picked men.

evocatos z these were veterans, who had served out their time,
but were induced to volunteer by the offer of special privileges and

mand ; particularly of the auxiliaries or the fleet.

legatus, staffiofficer or aid. All these held subordinate com-

mancis, under the imperium of the commander in chief; the praetor
had the imperinm in virtue of his office, and was therefore the com-

mander in chief of the army.
ἕ 60. ferentariis», skz'a‘mz'shem, armed with sword and spear, and

light defensive armor. —— omittunt, drop.

pila . . . geritur. The Roman mode of attack was, first to hurl
the pilum (eminus pugnare), and then rush upon the enemy with
the sword (cominus pugnare); precisely a'nalogous to a modern
volley of musketry followed by a bayonet charge.
