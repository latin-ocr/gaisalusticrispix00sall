This book is an attempt to bridge the gap between the
first Latin manual, covering forms and simple constructions‚
and a continuous Classical work? like the ‘⁴ Lives of Nepos''
or Caesar's “Gallic War.'' It has been proved by experi-
ence that discouragement and great loss of time result from
plunging beginners too early into difficult Latin.

This book is designed for a few months of rapid reading,
beginning with selections from “The New Gradatim,⁷' and
ending with the “Life of Caesar³³ and the “Alcibiades'' of
Nepos slightly simplified.

E. C. Warriner, Principal cys szgrlz Sclzool (East Side), saginam,
Mida: It is an excellent selection of easy Latin reading, and a book
which is admirably suited for the purpose intended.

Emma A. Scudder, Teaclzer (gf Latin, English Hzgglz Sclzool‚ Cam-
bridge, lmus..- The subject-matter is interesting, well arranged, and
attractive in every respect. I wish we might have such a work intro-
duced into our school to precede Nepos and Caesar.

Thomas FitZ—Hugh‚ Prcgfessor of Latin, Universizjv of T exas, A nstin,
Texu· It shows the same eminently practical and efficient qualities that
characterize all of Mr. Collar’s text—books. Ι entirely approve of the
general plan. Ι can imagine no more useful and available manual for
every purpose involved in our discussions.

C. C. Ramsey, Prz'ncipal of Hz'glz Sclzool, Fall Κίων, lllass. .· A capital
Latin reader ; the notes and vocabulary are excellent and the selections
could not be better.
