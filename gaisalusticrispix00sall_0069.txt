action 3 Autronius distinguished for nothing but his powerful seream-
ing voice; while as to Lucius Cassius, no one could comprehend how
a man so corpulent and so simple had fallen among the conspira-
tors. But Catiline could not venture to place his abler partisans,
such as the young senator Caius Cethegus and the equites Lucius
Statilius and Publius Gabinius Capito at the head of the movement3
for even among the conspirators the traditional hierarchy of rank
held its ground, and the very anarchists thought that they should be
unable to carry the day unless a consular or at least a praetorian

were at their head.''

Cassius was, with Catiline and Cicero, a candidate for the con-
sulship for B.c. 63. The two Sullas were nephews of the dictator.
L. Vargunteius is called by Cicero (Cat, Ι. 9) eques Romanzcs; it was
he and C. Cornelius that undertook to assassinate Cicero in his bed.
Of the other conspirators nothing special need be said.

coloniis, municipiis 3 colonies were established by the Roman
government to serve as permanent military posts ; municipia were
Italian towns which had lost their original independence, been ab-
sorbed in the Roman State, and received Roman citizenship. At
this time there was no longer any material difference between the
two except in name. (See notes to Cicero, p. 5).

domi nobiles, of rank at home: however insignificant at the
capital, they were leading men in their own communities.

occultius (adv.) limits participes, more secrelly slcczring in.

nobileS, noblemen .· the Roman nobility consisted of those whose
ancestors had held high offices of State. Thus Cicero, being a ‘⁴ new
man ⁷⁷ (novus homo), was not strictly a member of the nobility.

M. Licinium Crassum: a nobleman of high rank and enormous
wealth, which he had got by speculating in real estate at the time of
the terrorism of Sulla's proscriptions. He was possessed by an
uneasy military and political ambition, and had won some credit as
commander against the revolted slaves under Spartacus, ΒΕ. 71.
He managed to get into office by the influence of his money, and by
allying himself with more competent men, as P01npey(ss.c. 71 δε 60)
and Caesar (13.0. 60). His inordinate ambition carried him at last
into an enterprise too large for his powers, against the Parthian
Empire, in which he lost his life, B.C. 53. His connection, as well
as Caesar’s, with the reckless schemes of Catiline (see ἐξ 48, 49) is
very doubtful, though believed by many scholars. It is not unlikely
in itself, as both were ambitious and unscrupulous men, and knew,
as Sallust says (ἓ 39), that the ablest and boldest man would in the
end reap the fruits of the conspiracy : and that was Caesar.
