THIS new edition of Cicero has been treated with special reference to
the use of the orations as models of classic oratory. The Introduction
is made to help in this study of applied logie and rhetoric. There is a
full life of Cicero, describing his education and development as an orator,
as well as his political career. There is a chapter connecting the style of
the orations with ancient formal rhetoric. There is also a chapter on
Roman oratory and the place of the orator in ancient civilization.

The text includes the following orations: The Manilian Law, four
orations against Catiline, Archias, Milo, Marcellus, Ligarius, the four-
teenth Philippic, and copious extracts from the Defence of Roscius and
the Actio Secunda against Verres.

Almost everything admitting of graphic presentation has an illus-
tration, and no little study has been expended in finding the most suit-
able pictures. Views of places, scenes of Roman life, and portraits have
been specially sought. Many coins are shown. The illustrations are
fully explained in the Index, with criticisms.
