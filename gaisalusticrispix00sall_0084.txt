plebeian assembly of the tribes, They had the power of forbidding
almost any public proceeding, and os holding assemblies of the ple-
beians, which passed laws for the whole people (566 note, ἓ 33), and
imposed fines.

summam potestatem, not imperium. The tribunes had no* im-

perium, or supreme authority to command ; their potestas, or poli-
tical power, was, however, in some respects even greater than that
of the consuls. They could seize and imprison any person even
a magistrate, while they themselves were sacrosancti, and therefore
their persons could not be touched. It may be noticed that this
restoration of the tribunician power was only four years before the
first conspiracy of Catiline.

cliaa'ys). ⁴

the arrogance of the aristocracy (ei, etc.).

ipsi innoxii, themselves unmolestecl: a less common but ap-
parently the original meaning of the word (ξ 164. m. The termina-

cutious tliose of tlie otlzer party (the populares), so as to deal more
at tlzeir ease witti tlte people wliile ia office. Prosecutions could be

political or persona] hostility.

sc. reS‚ making a revolution.

vetus certamen, etc., tlie old quarrel roused their passionS, i. e.
of the leaders of the opposite or popular party (ceteros). The ob-
ject of the optimates (paucorum) seems to have been to overawe
their opponentS, or wear them out with incessant prosecutions‚—
the same course which the party in power has so often followed
towards the opposition newspapers in Paris. But as soon as the
crisis came (dubiis rebus), and there seemed a chance for making
a stir (novandi), the popular leaders eagerly took up the old
quarrel.
