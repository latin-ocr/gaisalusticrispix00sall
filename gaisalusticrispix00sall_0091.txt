CAT. 48-51·] ᾗ Notcs. 75

29. ἓ 50. liberti, freedmen. A freed slave was libertus as
regarded his former master (who now became his patronus), and
libertinus as regarded others. Lentuli must therefore limit liberti
as well as clientibus: the clients were his free-born followers.

in vicis, iu tlze streets; or, more correct-ly, the wards or districts
centring about the several principa] streets.

duces multitudinum, woh—leaders .· petty politicians, leaders of
the populace in the several localities.

per nuntios orabat: it would seem from this that the libera
custodia was “free'' enough to allow a prisoner correspondence
with his friend with a view to a rescue. It was, however, rigid
enough to keep him in durance, under the immediate peril of
execution.

familiam, llouselzold of slaves.

monebat, suggested. ——convocato senatu; this was Dec. 5.

contra rem publicam, “against the peace and dignity of the
commonwealth.⁷’

primus sententiam rogatus: the consuls elect were called upon
first, if there were any ; if not, the princeps senalus, or one who was
recognized as holding the first rank : then, in succession, the con-
sular, praetorian and other senators,

decreverat: the pluperfect is a common device to subordinate

pedibus iturum (sc. in sententiam), would vote, i. e. on a
division. The vote was taken by going on one side or the other of
the hall (discessio). A class of Senators, who had a vote, but no
right to speak, were called pedarii.

Nero’s proposition was to put off the decision until further measures
for security should have been taken (proesidiis additis). This is
not inconsistent with Cicero’s referring only to the propositions of
Silanus and Caesar (Cat. IV. 7) 3 for Nero's notion had nothing to
do with the merits of the question, but only with the time of action,
so that Silanus agreed to it.

Caesar: as proelor deszgnatus, he spoke after the consulars and
before the praetorians. It is a missortune that Sallust’s vanity led
him to compose —in the fashion of ancient historians—this arti-
