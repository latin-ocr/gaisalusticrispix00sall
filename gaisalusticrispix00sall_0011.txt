His colleague Antonius—whom, half by bribery and half
by flattery or threats, he had turned against them —was com-
pelled, with whatever reluctance, to take the field to fight
them, and, though conveniently lame on the day of battle,
had forced upon him the military glory of their defeat. The
conspiracy proper was quite annihilated by this blow. No
avowed leader or accomplice in it seems to have been left
in Rome. And it was not till the coalition of Caesar, Pom-
pey, and Crassus, three years later, gave new hope to the
enemies of the Senate, and Clodius succeeded Catiline as
the leader of what was most ferocious and desperate in
Rome, that Cicero met the penalty of his great political
error, the illegal death of the conspirators.

In the logic of events, this conspiracy was a seque] to the
revolution of Sulla, and a prelude to the overthrow of
the republic by Caesar. While nominally a conservative,
Sulla had been, in reality, an innovator of the most danger-
ous type. He had set himself in armed opposition to a
reform, which, though disfigured from the times of the
Gracchi by many acts of violence, might yet have saved for
many generations the free political life of Rome. The
great ‘political crime of Sulla was that he deliberately de·
stroyed the existing constitution, to restore by force that
which had been outgrown a hundred years before. A
still more fatal policy was to subvert the popular life of the
Italian communities, and to destroy, as far as he could, the re-
mains ofthat free yeomanry which — though in arms against
Rome in the ‘⁶ Social War'' — made now the best hope of
the Republic. The dictator must provide landed estates for
his veterans, whatever came of it; and the wide-spread ruin
and despair that rose from this made the chief reliance of
the conspiracy. The horrible civil war, with its massacres
on one side and its proscriptions on the other, had fatally
corrupted the very springs of political morality. It had even
destroyed (so to speak) the political sense. Politics had
been bad enough before. Party controversies had often
resulted in assassination, massacre, and exile. Now, it was
