54 lee Conspz'racy os Catiline. [SALL,

invisus: although Pompey and Crassus had joined hands and
held the consulship together in B.C. 70, yet this was only a tem-
porary suspension of their rivalry, and indeed the year was dis-
tracted by their discussions.

ductabat=dux erat.—cujusviS, aJWbody’s.-vo1uisse, sc.
eum, i. e. Crassus—illiue», Pompey’s.

and Μ’. AEmilius Lepidus were consuls, B.C. 66.

P. Sulla, not to be confounded with the conspirator of the same
name, mentioned in the last chapter. This man too was a kinsrnan
of the dictator, and a man of worthless character ; but his participa-
tion in the conspiracy was at any rate doubtful, and he was de-
fended on the charge by Cicero, and acquitted.

Cn. Piso, of the Calpurnian gens. — cum hoc, with him.

[see next chapter). The Nones of every month, except March, May,
July, and October, were the 5th‚ on these months the 7th. On the
