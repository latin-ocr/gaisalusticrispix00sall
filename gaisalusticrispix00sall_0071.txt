Iberus, the old boundary between the Roman and Carthaginian ter-

Sulla. The Marian commander, Sertorius, held Spain long after
the rest of the empire had succumbed to Sulla.

The praetors were judicial magistrates—at this time eight in number
—who ranked next to the consuls, and could in case of need act in
their stead. Like them, too, their power (imperium) was extended
(prorogatum) a second year with executive functions in the pro-
vinces (pro praetore, proproelor). Occasionally, as in this case,
interior magistrates were invested by the Senate with the imperinm,
and sent pro proelom’ to govern provinces. The quaestors were
Officers of the lowest grade, who had charge of the treasury in the
city, and the military chest abroad.

voluntarily became the dependants and followers of some noble.
But men of rank in a province or municipal town might stand in the
relation of client to a powerful nobleman at Rome. This charge
against Pompey would naturally come from a partisan of Caesar,
like Sallust ; but it is without foundation.
