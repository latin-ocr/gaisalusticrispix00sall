viii Introduction.

in regular form, and then to carry on the government to
their own advantage. Apart from the character of the men
who engaged in it, it does not seem to have been any more
criminal in its origin or plans than any ‘⁴ ring '' or cabal by

which a personal interest seeks its ends through the forms
of constitutional election. Only when, after three years’

attempt, it was finally defeated at the polls, and appealed
to armed insurrection, did it take the shape of treason. And
even then it kept the formalities of civil and military author—

ity, and rejected the help of slaves3 claiming that its real ·

object was to rid the state of an oppressive and selfish oli-
garchy. That its real aim was to destroy the state — which
Cicero asserts—was, at any rate, so well disguised, that
the party which succeeded in overcoming it fell into odium
as enemies of the people, and found their own ruin in its
defeat.

These circumstances have made the true character and
aims of the conspiracy one of the riddles of Roman politics.
Cicero, in a well-known passage (Cat. IL), ranges the con-
spirators in five “dangerous classes,'' of which the most
respectable were men of large estates lieavily mortgaged,
whose debts made them ready to welcome any sort of
change. But they, as he shows, could have no real interest
in a revolution. And it may be safe, perhaps, along with
many critics, to dismiss the stories of bloody rites, criminal
oaths, and desperate designs of massacre and conflagration,
as the tales of frightened fancy and political hate. But of
the reckless and criminal character of its leaders, and the
mischief they would have done if they had got into office,
there seems no reason for doubt. As candidate, Cicero
had beaten them fairly in a hard-fought battle at the polls.
As consul, he had worked, actively and effectually, to block
their further politica] game. When they were finally de-
feated, in the fall elections of his consular year, and lost
heart to try again, he was vigilant, shrewd, intrepid, and
successful, in tracking their schemes of open violence,
and forcing the development of their plot beyond the walls.
