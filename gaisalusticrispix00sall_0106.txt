THIS new edition of Virgil contains a longer Introduction, dealing
fully with his life and times, his art, his literary influence, and similar
subjects. A special aim of the introduction and notes is to introduce
the student to a literary study of Virgil and so open the way to a fruit-
ful reading of the classic authors generally. The learner is skilfully
introduced to scansion. Full information and practical directions are
given, and, in particular, English prosody is made the gate to Latin
prosody.

The notes have been faithfully revised. The grammatica] references
have been made to fit the latest editions of the grammars.

A special feature of the notes is the attempt to illustrate by quotations
from a wide range of English poets. Virgil, thus studied‚ should become
a most valuable aid in the general literary culture of the pupil.

Close and discriminating care h as been given to the illustrations. Fac-
simile reproduction has been largely employed in this edition as the only
satisfactory process. Fine engravings on wood have been presented
where the subject allowed, and the pictures as a whole are believed to
possess remarkable power and beauty as well as illustrative value.
