lex Porcia, about B.C. 200 : “virgas ab omnium civium Roman-
orum corpore amovit 3 libertatem civium lictori eripuit '³ (Cic.
pro Rabir, ch. 4).

at aliae leges, etc. : i. e. if scourging is forbidden (by the Porcian
law), much more is it forbidden, by several laws, to put them to
death. The whole subject is very obscure, and the precise import
of these laws is not known. To -all intents and purposes, in the later
republic, the punishment of death for Roman citizens was out of use,
since, as is here stated, the condemned criminal was allowed to go
away and become an alien from his country. But exile from
Rome was even worse to a Roman than exile from Paris is to a
F renchman.

omnia male exempla, etc. Certainly, whether Caesar was in
sympathy with the conspirators or not, he could not have said a
truer thing than these ominous words, let them be his own clear
foresight, or Sallust's cheap moralizing after the fact. The most
dangerous violations of ‘law are by those who give their act the
sanction of a high example.
