domi militiaeque, at home or in tlle field (5 258. d). In this
familiar phrase, mz'litioe (also belli) does not at all imply actual war-
fare, but is used hy way of contrast with the regular order of things
within the city walls, to describe the field over which the war power
and the laws of war have authority. Within the city (domi) the
imperimn, or power of the magistrate to command, is limited by
certain provisions which are designed to protect the liberty of the
individual, and this is 50 even in war : outside of the city (mz'litz'a’)
these limitations do not exist, but the magistrate, even in peace,
possesses full war powers. Within the city, the limitations might
be suspended by the⁴ Senate in cases of great urgency, by ordering
Videant [darent operam] consules, etc. (p. 17). This was equivalent
to declaring martial law.

Trojani: it is interesting to notice how completely Sallust's

and Alba Longa, but speaks of Rome as founded immediately
by AEneas.

profugi . . . vagabantur, roamed as exiles, with no fixed homes
(abl. of qualification), i. e. driven from one place to another.

Aborigines=2'nd22ge220us‚ i. e. natives. The Roman antiqua—
rians made much confusion by supposing that this epithet of the
native Latins was the name of an independent earlier race, which
formed the Latins by uniting with the foreign Trojans.

agreste, uncoutlz. —sine imperio, i. e. with no master, or ruler.
— solutum, unrestraz‘ned (by law).
