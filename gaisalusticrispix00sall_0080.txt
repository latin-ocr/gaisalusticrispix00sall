that the strictness (scevz'tia) of the praetor—i. e. the proetor urbanus,
the judge in cases between citizens in administering the laws —did
not allow the debtor to take all the advantages (lage uti) permitted
by custom (more majornm): so that they were left to the rigor
(scevl'z‘l'a) of the creditors. These not only took their estate (amisso
patrimonio), but their personal freedom (liberum corpus habere).

opitulati sunt (ΟΡΙ TUL in tollo, tuli), came [0 tlze relies .· this
appears to refer to the laws of C. Gracchus and others, by which
corn was sold to the poor at a rate below cost.

novissume, very lczlcly: a law passed by L. Valerius Flaccus,
successor of Marius in the consulship, B.C. 86, provided that debts
should be cancelled by the payment ofa fourth of their value ; that
is, the silver sestertius should be paid with a copper as (mgentum
(ere) ,· the sestertius being equal to four asses. To say that this was
done volentibus omnibus bonis, seems like a huge joke.

saepe . . . secessit, the plebs many limes withdraw in arms, etc.
This was done three times. The first time (EC. 494) their demands
were satisfied by the institution of their special magistrates, the
tribunes; the last time (ILC. 287) by the Hortensian Law, which
gave to votes of the plebs (plebi scita) the force of laws.

consularibus, cur-consuls. An ex-magistrate always retained the
rank of the office which he had held, as consularis, praetorius,

Massiliam, stlarseilles, a very ancient Greek colony in Gaul,
always in the closest and friendliest relations with Rome. It was a

Catulus: Q. Lutatius Catulus was the acknowledged leader of‘
the senatorial or aristocratic faction‚ and second to none in purity
and uprightness of character. He was consul B.C. 78, with M.
Lepidus (see note, ξ 31), whose democratic schemes he successfully
resisted. His father, of the same name and similar reputation‚ was
consul with Marius, nc. 102, and gained with him the great victory
over the Cimbri the next year: he was afterwards assassinated by
command of Marius in the civil war, ss.C. 87.
