THIS new edition of Caesar‘s ‘⁴ Gallie VVar” keeps prominently
in view the needs of the beginner, on the ground that a large
majority of those who read Caesar take it up immediately after
finishing their first lessons. It is believed that all this class of
students⁷ needs have been fully met in the present edition.

Professor Greenough has specially qualified himself for editing
this edition by traveling and making recent investigations in
France. Not only the notes, but the illustrations have profited
greatly. A considerable number of the pictures in this edition are
from photographs made especially for it. In other cases, pictures
not previously seen in this country have been obtained. The
museums have been visited and many new illustrations drawn
from them. At the same time, all the standard and essential
illustrations are used. It is believed that this part of the editing
will be found of signal excellence and practical value.

Several reading courses are suggested, each one of which,
while embracing an amount of text equal to the first four books,
contains choice selections of narrative and adventure from the
various books. It is believed that this feature will be especially
acceptable to teachers who have found the monotony of Caesar
irksome, but have seen no way to vary the course.

The text has been revised, many changes having been made, and
the whole presents the commentaries in an ideal form for rapid and
enj0yable reading. Quantities of long vowels are marked.
