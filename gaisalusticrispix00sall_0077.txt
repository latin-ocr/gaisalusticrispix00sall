CAT. 26—30.] AVotes. 61

judicium summum, llzefimzl appeczl in question of right.

nullius earum rerum: this is not exact. It was only domi,
“within the city‚’' that the power of the consul was thus limited;
“ abroad '’ (mz'lz'tice), he regularly possessed all that power by virtue
of his office (jussu populi). The decree only gave the same power
at home that he already had abroad. All-the real force therefore
of the description here given is surnmed up in coc'frcere civis, domi
imperinm, etc„ habere.

ξ 30. ante diem vi„ i. e. Oct. 27. —id quod, as.

portenta: the Romans were excessively superstitious in such
matters. In fact, their whole polity rested on the auspicesj and the
portenta* interpreted by these were often the most insignificant
accidents.

conventus, meetings of any kind: here, secret meetings of con-
spirators, probably in the country districts of Italy, where there was
an old jealousy of Rome. In Capua, especially, the second town in
Italy, and the old rival of Rome, constantly deprived of all effective
sels-government by the jealousy of Rome (see Cicero⁷s Second
Oration on the Agrarian law), there would be a readiness to throw
off Roman rule. Apulia was a grazing country, consisting in the
main of public land, which was rented to capitalists, and left in
charge of gangs (fcmlilz’oe) of slaves.

moveri, was stirred up. —senati, old gen. (ξ 70. a).

Q. Marcius Rex, cos. 68; Q. Metellus Creticus, cos, 69: he
was the fast friend of Verres at the time of his trial the year before.
circum (here equivalent to an adjective), llle places amand.

ad urbem, near tlte city .· not in it, because as imperatores they
could not enter the city without losing their right to a triumph.
They had, as proconsuls, governed provinces after the expiration of
their consulship (Rex had Cilicia and Metellus Crete), and had re-
turned home with sufficient military success to warrant ¹the honor of
a triumph. This was hindered, however, calumnia paucorum (es-
pecially of Pompey, who regarded them as his lieutenants in virtue
of the Gabinian and Manilian Laws), and they were waiting for the
matter to be decided. If they entered the pomaerium, or city en-
closure, their prorogued imperium, or military command, would
expire by that very act. They remained therefore in the neighbor-
hood (ad urbem) with their armies, and attended to necessary public
business by summoning the Senate to meet them in some temple
*outside the walls.

praetores, sc. missi sunt.

Pompeius, an unimportant character ; Celer, a prominent mem-
ber of the aristocracy, cos. Rc. 60 : he died the year following. ·

uti earlier form of ut (probably an old locative). —pro . . . pe-
riculo = consz‘derz'ng tlte peril of tlte time.
