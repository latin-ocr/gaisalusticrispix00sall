INTRODUCTION.

Lucms SERGIUS CATILINA was an old soldier and parti-
san of Sulla, a man of profligate character, broken fortunes,
and headstrong ambition. About twelve years after Sulla’s
death, he formed a scheme to better his estate by political

probably, needy and reckless fortune-hunters. His plan
was to get himself into power in the ordinary way of
popular elections3 then, by the spoils and chauces of office,

and Caius Antonius. Renewing his attempt at the next
elections, he was again defeated, and, when driven from
the city by the invective of Cicero, he raised the standard '
of open insurrection. His confederates in the city were
seized and put to death, and in the following january, a
month later, he was beaten in battle, and his armed force
completely annihilated.
