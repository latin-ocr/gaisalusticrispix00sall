xii Introduction .

criticism does not support this view. His merits as a writer
are doubtless very great. He is master of a terse, senten-
tious, manly style, ——oris probi, animo inverecundo, — and
tells his story with considerable narrative power. But, corn-
pared with Thucydides or with Tacitus, his writings show no
real earnestness or dignity3 the elaborate political disquisi-
tions and moral reflections seem forced ; his descriptions,
though vigorous and compact, lael< that wonderful vividness
which we find in those great historians. He gives the im-
pression of a rhetorician, saying — finely — what he thinks it
is proper for him to say, rather than expressing genuine feel-
ings and opinions. He has been called a pessimist, cynical,
and blas& and has been accused of unfairness, particularly
of hostility to Cicero. But this last charge is certainly not
made out: the ‘⁴ Catiline,’' at least, is remarkably free from
partisan feeling, except as it may perhaps echo the scandals
or the temper of the period. And the debaucheries, of which
Sallust's earlier career is accused, were greatly atoned by
the honest attempt he seems to have made, later in his life,
to leave a fit and instructive record of a remarkable time.
