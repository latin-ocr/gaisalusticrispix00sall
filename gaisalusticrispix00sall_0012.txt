deliberately resolved to settle all such questions by uie
sword. When Sulla (B.c. 88), on being directed by the
authority of the State to surrender his command to Marius,
refused to obey, but marched instead upon the city, and put
his antagonists to the sword, the Republic was at an end.
Though nominally restored, it was after this an empty form.
It opened the field for the swift victories of Pompey, the
eloquent career of CicerO, the brilliant exploits of Caesar.
But its political life was a series of violences, conspiracies,
and cabals. The real power was only waiting for the man
who had the capacity and the will to take it. When the
forces of faction were at length exhausted, the wary craft of
Octavianus easily gathered the ripe spoils of empire.

The conspiracy of Catiline was, at most, a futile attempt
to do what Sulla had done once, and what Caesar did after- ¹
wards. It failed, partly because it was undertaken by an

incompetent chief3 but mainly because it was an impatient
effort to hasten the natural course of events. The revolutions
of Sulla and of Caesar grew out of a long series of trans-
actions; they were seen coming, and prepared for long
beforehand. It was otherwise in Catiline's case. There was
no great convulsion which his success might seem to heal,
no war of parties to which he might offer the bribe of peace.
There was discontent enough to appeal to, and misgovern-
ment enough to assail. And it may be that he was used by
wiliel· and abler plotters, to feel whether the time was ripe.
But the success of such a movement could have been nothing
but a pure tyranny‚ without even the plea of necessity, which
Caesar and perhaps Sulla might urge. It is, therefore, not
a great event of history, but only an episode, or at most a
significant incident. It grew out of the disorder of the
times3 it also reacted upon them, did much immediate
mischief, and probably hastened the final catastrophe. Stin,
if we knew nothing of it except the fact that it took place,
the real loss to history would be slight and indirect. We
could not afford, it is true, to lose Sallust's narrative of the
conspiracy, or Cicero’s orations against its chief. But we
