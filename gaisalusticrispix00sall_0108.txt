Space does not allow here a full description of this book,
but attention is called to the following points :

First. Allen and Greenough's Shorter Latin Grammar does not
attempt the impossible. It does not aim to be at once a brief grammar
and a full one, to cover both preparatory and college Latin courses in a
space sufficient for only the former.

Second. The reduction of size is secured not by retaining arbi-
trarily what one or two scholars deem essential, but by ascertaining
minutely what points are involved in the study of preparatory Latin.
It must be admitted that any one who attacks the problem in this way
will find that a great deal more information is required for thorough
reading of the preparatory texts than any a priori maker of a short
Latin grammar would suppose.

Third. It has been found entirely feasible to follow the section
numbering of the large Allen and Greenough Grammar, so that the
full and the short grammars can be used in the same classes and the
same set of references apply. If a class includes boys who are going
to college and also boys who are not, the former may purchase the
full grammar and the latter the short one.

Fourth. The Latin grammar that shall be thoroughly satisfac-
tory under all the conditions it is to meet in thousands of schools of
every sort, must be a growth‚ and it is believed that the experience of
making a full and complete grammar and of watching the use of it
in schools for years, is almost a prerequisite to the preparation of a .
thoroughly satisfactory small one. -
