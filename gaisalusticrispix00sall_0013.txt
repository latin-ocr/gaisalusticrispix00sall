Of Sallust - CAIUS SALUSTIUS CRISPUS—we know little
that is worth knowing, except the bare outlines of his life,
and the fact that he was a constant partisan of Caesar. He
was born B. C. 86, just twenty years later than Cicero.
He was never very prominent in the politics of Rome,
though he says that in his youth he had strong inducements
to enter public life. His private life was charged as scandal-
ous; he was once, it is said, soundly thrashed by Milo for
attentions to his wife, and was afterwards expelled from
the Senate by the partisans of Pompey. He served Caesar
rather inefficiently in the Civil WVar3 and was made by him
governor (proprcelor) of the provinces of Africa and Numi-
dia. Here he gathered the usual spoils of great wealth, and
the rarer treasure of historic material which he used in his
romantic and striking narrative of the career ofJugurtha, the
great Numidian chieftain. His gardens in Rome were
proverbial for luxury and splendor3 and he lived in retired
indulgence, apart from the later struggles of the Common-

wealth, till his death in Β. C. 35.
As historiam, it was the plan of Sallust to write out the

history of his own times, beginning with the death of Sulla.
He seems also to have touched upon earlier events, especially
the Social or Marsic WVar3 and his history ofJugurtha may
be regarded as a sort of introduction to the civil wars of
RIarius, whose earlier political career is told in it. His
practice was to write in episodeS, or fragments; and of his
more general scheme only the narrative of Catiline's con-
spiracy remains, with a few speeches and letters, which are
little else than pieces of rhetorical composition.

The ancients ranked Sallust very high as a writer, and
did not scruple to compare him to Thucydides* Modern

* Sed non historia cesserit Graecis, nec opponere Thucydidi Salustium
verear. Quint. x. 1, 101.
