THIS is offered as a thoroughly satisfactory manual for preparatory
schools and colleges, and it is believed to combine excellences of di-
verse kinds in such a way as to be the closest possible approach to an
ideal grammar.

Fir-st. This has always been regarded as the truest and soundest of
Latin grammar manuals. Instead of making arbitrary laws and distinc-
tions in order to secure an artificial clearness of statement, this gram-
mar has been faithful to the spirit and the facts of the language. This
is its fundamental excellence. The grammar explains the language
instead of trying to make the language bear out the grammar.

Second. The present edition is as strong in class-room availability
as it is for linguistic truth. George L. Kittredge‚ Professor of English
at Harvard, was associate reviser, and largely on account of his com-
bining special qualifications in Latin and in English, the style of the
grammar was radically improved. It is believed to be now much clearer,
more crisp and definite, more interesting and learnable‚ than any other
grammar.

Third. Even in all the little points, the closest care was taken in the
revision, and scarcely a book can be found in which the excellence is
so uniform and in which the finish reaches so faithfully to the minutest
details.

Fourth. In a word, the consensus of competent opinion seems to
fully justify the belief that Allen and Greenough's Latin Grammar is
clearly the best: best for scholarship‚ convenience, completeness, and
beauty; best for reference; and best for regular study.
