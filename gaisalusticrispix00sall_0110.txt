HIS little book is designed to be helpful to those who desire to do

more sight reading in secondary schools. It is intended especially

for students who wish to learn to read Latin easily and need an
elementary guide.

The author holds that students should be taught to read, and to
understand as they read, without translation, from the very beginning.
The aim from the outset should be to learn to read Latin. This is not
so difficult, in the opinion of the author, as it seems, and pupils in
secondary schools can with proper instruction acquire considerable
facility in this direction.

For a well-graded series of selections for higher schools nothing
better can be found than Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles, Lhomond's Urbis
Romae Viri lnlustres, and Gellius’ Aba-tes Atticae. The selections of
this book have accordingly been made from these three sources. The
Fabulae Faciles may be used to advantage during the latter half of the
first year and the first part of the second3 the selections from Viri
Romae come next in difficulty, and then those from Gellius. It has
been the plan of the author to afford sufficient and suitable material
for the entire preparatory course. The quantities are marked.

From considerable experience with classes in sight reading, and
from the experience and publications of others, Professor D'Ooge has
compiled and formulated in a few introductory pages some hints and
suggestions that will be found'useful in teaching the art of reading
Latin. These are followed by a few models for written lessons, which
will be of practical use to the young student.

The increasing and very proper emphasis placed upon translation
at sight in the curricula of all our best higher schools and colleges has
insured a cordial welcome to this little book.
